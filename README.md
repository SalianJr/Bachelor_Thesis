An entry into to the world of spacecraft trajectory design and optimization. The problem statement is to capture two planetary systems with one launch from earth, which means the initial part of the trajectory of a spacecraft which separates into two has to be the same. After separation, one half of the spacecraft will capture Saturn after taking a fly-by from Jupiter, whereas the other half will capture Jupiter. Possible location of separation of the two halves of the spacecraft ( in terms of days from launch ) is found out.
